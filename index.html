          Newton was an English physicist, mathematician, astronomer,
           natural philosopher, alchemist, theologian and one of the most
            influential men in human history. His Philosophiæ Naturalis
             Principia Mathematica, published in 1687, is considered to
              be the most influential book in the history of science.

     Einstein, a German physicist, is best known
      for his theory of relativity and specifically
       mass–energy equivalence, expressed by the
        equation E = mc2. Einstein received the
        1921 Nobel Prize in Physics “for his services
         to Theoretical Physics, and especially for
          his discovery of the law of the photoelectric
           effect.

    <i>“The scientists of
      today think deeply instead of clearly.
       One must be sane to think clearly,
        but one can think deeply and be quite
        insane.”</i>

     <br>
     Tesla was a Serbian engineer and inventor
      who is often described as the most important
       scientist and inventor of the modern age,
        a man who “shed light over the face of Earth”.
         He is best known for many revolutionary
          contributions in the field of electricity
           and magnetism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
